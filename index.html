      You are my love, my peace, my joy, my quitet place, you are the shine in a
      dark day, you are the light in the end of the tunnel, you are the smile on
      my face, the voice in my laughter, when I have nothing to think about I
      think of you, when I have everything to think about I think of you, You
      are my first and last thought of the day, In the day you are my sun, in
      the night you are my moon, Maya, I love you so much, more than words can
      say, more than actions can show. You are my love.
      <br />
      I love you.
    </p>
    <button onclick="alert('I love you more than words can say ðŸ’—')">
      Click me!
